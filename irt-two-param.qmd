# Two-parameter IRT model

Mathematically, the two-parameter IRT model has a discrimination parameter in addition to the item difficulty parameter.

$$
Prob(X=1) = \frac{\exp(a(\theta - \delta))}{1+\exp(a(\theta - \delta))}
$$

where *a* is called the discrimination parameter.

The result of including a discrimination parameter is that the slopes of the Item Characteristic Curves are no longer parallel.

Under the Rasch model, for any person, Item 1 is easier than Item 2 which is easier than item 3.

Under the two-parameter IRT model ICCs are not parallel. For a person with ability measure of -1 logit, Item 1 is the easiest item. But for a person with an ability of 2 logits, Item 2 is the easiest item.


```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
rm(list=ls())  #remove all objects in the R environment
require(tidyverse)
```

## Exercise

Amend the equation for the Rasch model so that it now has a discrimination parameter. Plot ICCs with different discrimination parameters to see the impact of manipulating alpha.

```{r}
#| label: fig-item-cc
#| fig-cap: Item Characteristic Curve
#Calculate prob as a function the theta
id = 1 #Â item id
delta <- 1 #item difficulty is 1
theta <- seq(-3,3,0.01) #a vector of theta from -3 to 3 in steps of 0.01
irt_function <- function(alpha, theta, delta){
    
}

```
