# Verifying your installation

Once you have installed your tools, you should be able to recreate the example shown here: <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html>

Inside VS Code, click on View - Command Palette and type "Quarto: New Document" to create a new Quarto document.

Then look for Render in the upper right hand corner. You will be prompted to install any missing packages. If you need to do this you need to open an R terminal in Visual Studio. Go to View - Command Palette and type "R: Create R Terminal". This will open a new terminal in the bottom of the screen. You can then type the following commands:

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You should then be able to paste the code from the example into your new document and run it. Along the way you will be prompted to install any missing packages.

**Exercises**

1. Using the example above, create one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output â€” Quarto will prompt you if this is necessary.)

2. Try out some markdown in your quarto document. Use <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html> to get a feel for markdown. Try and do the following:
* Embed an image
* Create a table
* Create a list
* Create a link
* Create an equation
* Create an R code block and solve the equation 23 + 45
