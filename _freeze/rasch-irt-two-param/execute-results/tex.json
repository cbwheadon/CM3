For a person with ability measure of -1 logit, Item 1 is the easiest item. But for a person with an ability of 2 logits, Item 2 is the easiest item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise\n\nAmend the equation for the Rasch model so that it now has a discrimination parameter. Plot ICCs with different discrimination parameters to see the impact of manipulating alpha.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Calculate prob as a function the theta\nid = 1 #Â item id\ndelta <- 1 #item difficulty is 1\ntheta <- seq(-3,3,0.01) #a vector of theta from -3 to 3 in steps of 0.01\nirt_function <- function(alpha, theta, delta){\n    \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nPlay the scoring game:\n\n<https://dexter-psychometrics.github.io/dexter/articles/blog/2018-09-24-the-scoring-game>\n\nHow do you feel about using the 2PL model to score a high stakes examination?\n\nNow read on ...\n\n<https://dexter-psychometrics.github.io/dexter/articles/blog/2022-06-20-Woes_with_2PL>",
