## R for data science
<https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>
The tidyverse is the modern method for data science in R. Note that this book uses RStudio with Quarto, but I recommend you run all examples in Quarto in VSCode.

I would highly recommend you work through the book, chapter by chapter. There are lots of good examples to work on.

## Assignment

‘I do not expect this model to hold at all if applied to items belonging to different fields of mathematics’ (Rasch, 1969, p. 100).

Rasch, G. 1969. “Personal communication, quoted”. In 1969 Item banking, Edited by: R. Wood and L. S. Skurnik Slough: National Foundation for Educational Research.

If you search Google scholar for papers in the field of Rasch measurement published since 2023 you will find a huge range of topics, far beyond Rasch's initial conception of an model that may work for a few maths items. Summarise the range of topics that you can see, and the motivations for using the Rasch model.
