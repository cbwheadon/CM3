# Test Information

## Take a look at the structure of the data
```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: true
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
#Â load in the dataset
responses <- read_csv('data/responses.csv')

# take a look at the structure of the data
glimpse(responses)
```

## Create a new variable called total with the sum of the item scores

```{r}
#| label: sum_scores
# sum across the columns with _score_ in the name and add to a new column called total.
# make sure to ignore missing values
# https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html
# https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pick.html?q=pick#ref-usage
responses <- responses %>% mutate(total = rowSums(pick(ends_with("_score")), na.rm = TRUE))
glimpse(responses)
```

## Table with number of candidates, mean, standard deviation, min and max

```{r}
#| label: basic-stats
#| table-cap: Summary statistics for the scores
# table with number of candidates, mean, standard deviation, min and max
# round all stats to 2 decimal places
summary_table <- responses %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(total),
    sd = sd(total),
    min = min(total),
    max = max(total)
  )
knitr::kable(summary_table, digits = 2,align = "c")
```

## Score Distribution

```{r}
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: Histogram of scores
#| width: 6
#| height: 4
#| include: true
ggplot (responses, aes(x = total)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 21) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, 1)) +
  # add a vertical line at the mean
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(responses$total), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
    # add the light theme
    theme_light() 


``` 

## What can we learn from the distribution of scores?
