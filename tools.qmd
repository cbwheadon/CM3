**posit Cloud**

If you do not have full admin permissions on your laptop I would recommend you use RStudio in the cloud. Sign up for a free account at Posit Cloud <https://posit.cloud/>

Follow the Getting Started Guide: <https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#intro>

If you do have full admin permissions on your laptop then you can use the desktop version of [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Advanced coders may prefer R in VSCode.

# Creating a Project in R Studio

I recommend working your way through this book, doing a little every day.
